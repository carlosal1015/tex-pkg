The seealso package

Copyright (C) 2014, 2017 by Leo Liu <leoliu.pku@gmail.com>

The package amends the \see and \seealso macros that are used in building
indexes with makeindex, to deal with repetitions, and to ensure page numbers
are present in the actual index entries.

This work is released under the LPPL v1.3c or later.

The project is hosted on https://github.com/leo-liu/tex-pkg
